      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>
        This policy applies to all information collected through The Emma App.
      </p>

      <h2>Information Emma Collects About You</h2>

      <p>
        The following list is the entirety of the information we store about
        you.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>An access token (received from Google)</li>
        <li>A refresh token (received from Google)</li>
        <li>An access token expiration date and time (received from Google)</li>
        <li>Your Gmail address (received from Google)</li>
        <li>
          The first and last names associated with your Gmail address (received
          from Google)
        </li>
        <li>A URL link to your Gmail address avatar (received from Google)</li>
        <li>A history ID (received from Google)</li>
        <li>A push notification token (received from iOS)</li>
        <li>Your phone number (received within The Emma App)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where Emma Gets This Stuff</h2>

      <p>
        We receive all but the last two items above when you consent to allow
        Google to share your information with The Emma App. You are prompted to
        grant consent when you sign into The Emma App.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/connections"
          >You can remove consent here</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        We store your push notification token if and when you opt to receive
        push notifications for new inbox emails in The Emma App. You are
        prompted to grant permission to share your push notification token after
        signing in to The Emma App with a Gmail account.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can disable our push notification token on your iOS device by going
        to Settings → Apps → Emma → Notifications and toggling the
        <b>Allow Notifications</b> switch.
      </p>

      <p>
        We store your phone number if you volunteer it within the settings
        section of The Emma App. You can remove our access to your phone number
        in the settings section of The Emma App.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Emma Keeps This Stuff</h2>

      <p>
        Your access and refresh tokens enable The Emma App to show you your
        inbox emails, as well as compose and deliver emails from your Gmail
        address in The Emma App. Consent to share your Google account
        information with The Emma App is necessary for The Emma App to function.
        The access token expiration date and times are also necessary to allow
        us to provide you with the aforementioned features unless and until you
        revoke The Emma App’s Gmail permissions.
        <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/connections"
          >You can remove consent here</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your Gmail address, first and last names, as well as your avatar are
        used to indicate to you which Gmail accounts you have linked to The Emma
        App. Again, you can
        <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/connections"
          >disable The Emma App’s access on a per-Gmail-account basis by
          following this link</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your history ID is used to show you your most up-to-date inbox when you
        open the app without having to pull to refresh your inbox emails list in
        The Emma App.
        <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/connections"
          >You can disable our access to updated history IDs here</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        We store your push notification token if and when you opt to receive
        push notifications for new inbox emails in The Emma App. This is an
        opt-in feature.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can disable our push notification token on your iOS device by going
        to Settings → Apps → Emma → Notifications and toggling the
        <b>Allow Notifications</b> switch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your phone number is used to resend you 2FA (two-factor authentication)
        codes as text messages when they’re sent to you as an email to make
        pre-filling them on your iPhone easier. This is an opt-in feature. You
        can remove our access to your phone number in the settings section of
        The Emma App.
      </p>

      <h2>Revoking Emma’s Access to This Stuff</h2>

      <p>
        <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/connections"
          >You can remove consent to share the above-listed Gmail account
          information with us here</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can disable our push notification token on your iOS device by going
        to Settings → Apps → Emma → Notifications and toggling the
        <b>Allow Notifications</b> switch.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can remove our access to your phone number in the settings section
        of The Emma App.
      </p>

      <h2>How Emma Protects This Stuff</h2>

      <p>
        The above-listed information is kept in a password-protected database at
        rest and encrypted in transit using the industry-standard TLS protocol.
      </p>

      <h2>Anonymized Information Emma Collects</h2>

      <p>
        The Emma App sends anonymized (not connected to your personally
        identifiable information in any way) crash reports to
        <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a>'s servers so that we may fix
        problems that cause The Emma App to break.
      </p>

      <h2>Ephemeral Information Emma Handles</h2>

      <p>
        All information discussed until this point refers to information that
        The Emma App collects and stores on disk. Other information passes
        through The Emma App’s servers, which we do not persist.
      </p>

      <p><b>Namely, your emails.</b></p>

      <p>
        Your emails pass through The Emma App’s servers because it’s Google’s
        preferred and secure way of allowing third-party applications like The
        Emma App to access and handle your data. Your emails exist on The Emma
        App’s servers only in memory and only while you’re fetching them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Plainly put, when you can see a loading spinner in the app, your emails
        exist on The Emma App’s servers in memory (not on disk). When the
        loading spinner goes away, The Emma App has finished forwarding your
        emails to your device and no longer has them on servers in any way (in
        memory, on disk, or in any other way).
      </p>

      <h2>Retention and Deletion of Google User Data</h2>

      <p>
        Google user data is retained only as long as necessary to provide our
        services. Removing a Gmail account from your Emma Email account will
        delete the Google user data for that account from our servers. If you
        delete your Emma Email account, all associated Google user data is
        permanently deleted from our servers.
      </p>

      <h2>In Summary</h2>

      <p>
        <b
          >Every bit of information you trust us with is used for the sole
          purpose of making The Emma App useful to its users.</b
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        We do not send marketing emails, push notifications, or text messages.
      </p>

      <p>We never call you.</p>

      <p>We do not sell your information.</p>
